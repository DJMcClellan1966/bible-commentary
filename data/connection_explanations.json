    "description": "Rich theological explanations for how Scripture passages connect",
    "purpose": "Provides deep explanations beyond simple word matching"
  },
  "thematic_explanations": {
    "covenant": {
      "explanation": "These passages are bound by the thread of covenant - God's binding commitment to His people. Throughout Scripture, God initiates relationship through covenant: with Noah (preservation), Abraham (promise), Moses (law), David (kingdom), and ultimately the New Covenant in Christ's blood. Each covenant builds upon the previous, revealing more of God's redemptive plan.",
      "christ_connection": "All covenants find their fulfillment in Christ. He is the faithful covenant-keeper where Israel failed. At the Last Supper, He declared 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood' (Luke 22:20). What was promised to Abraham, given through Moses, and typified in David is realized in Jesus."
    },
    "sacrifice": {
      "explanation": "The scarlet thread of sacrifice runs from Abel's offering through the Levitical system to Calvary. These passages share the understanding that sin requires atonement, that 'without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness' (Hebrews 9:22). Each Old Testament sacrifice was a shadow pointing to the substance.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is 'the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world' (John 1:29). Every animal sacrifice in the Old Testament was an IOU that Christ paid on the cross. He is both the perfect High Priest and the perfect sacrifice - offering Himself once for all (Hebrews 10:10)."
    },
    "redemption": {
      "explanation": "These passages echo with the theme of redemption - God buying back what was lost. The kinsman-redeemer (goel) in Israel had the right and responsibility to redeem family members from slavery or debt. This legal concept illuminates God's rescue of His people from Egypt and from sin.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is our kinsman-redeemer. He became flesh (our kinsman) to redeem us. 'You were redeemed, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ' (1 Peter 1:18-19). What Boaz did for Ruth, Christ does for the Church."
    },
    "kingdom": {
      "explanation": "The kingdom of God is the central theme connecting these passages. From Eden (where God walked with man) through Israel's theocracy, the Davidic monarchy, and the prophetic visions, Scripture traces God's reign over His creation and His people. The kingdom was lost in the Fall and progressively restored.",
      "christ_connection": "Jesus came proclaiming 'The kingdom of God is at hand' (Mark 1:15). In Him, God's reign breaks into human history. He is the King that David foreshadowed, ruling not with sword but with sacrificial love. His kingdom is 'not of this world' yet transforms this world."
    },
    "love": {
      "explanation": "Divine love (Hebrew: hesed, chesed; Greek: agape) connects these passages - not mere emotion but covenant faithfulness, steadfast commitment. God's love is unconditional, initiating, and sacrificial. It pursues the beloved even in their unfaithfulness, as seen in Hosea's pursuit of Gomer.",
      "christ_connection": "'God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us' (Romans 5:8). The cross is the ultimate revelation of divine love - not that we loved God, but that He loved us (1 John 4:10). Christ is hesed incarnate."
    },
    "faith": {
      "explanation": "Faith is the golden thread weaving through these passages - trusting God when circumstances seem impossible. From Abraham believing for a son, to Israel crossing the Red Sea, to David facing Goliath, faith is 'the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen' (Hebrews 11:1).",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is both the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2). He lived by perfect faith, trusting the Father even to death. We are saved by grace through faith - not faith in faith, but faith in Christ. He is the object worthy of our trust."
    },
    "righteousness": {
      "explanation": "Righteousness - right standing before God - connects these passages. The problem of how sinful humans can stand before a holy God runs throughout Scripture. The Law reveals God's standard; sacrifices provide covering; but true righteousness requires a deeper solution.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is 'our righteousness' (1 Corinthians 1:30). Through faith, His perfect righteousness is credited to us (2 Corinthians 5:21). What we could never achieve by works, God gives as gift. Christ fulfilled the Law's demands and offers us His record."
    },
    "sin": {
      "explanation": "These passages share the sobering theme of sin and its consequences. From the Fall onward, Scripture unflinchingly portrays human rebellion and its effects: broken relationships, death, exile, and separation from God. Sin is not merely rule-breaking but covenant-breaking.",
      "christ_connection": "'He who knew no sin became sin for us' (2 Corinthians 5:21). Christ entered the full weight of human sinfulness on the cross, bearing the curse we deserved. Where Adam failed, Christ succeeded. Where Israel broke covenant, Christ kept it perfectly."
    },
    "forgiveness": {
      "explanation": "Forgiveness flows through these passages - God's gracious cancellation of debt. The Hebrew words for forgiveness (nasa, salach, kaphar) mean to lift away, to pardon, to cover. Forgiveness is costly - it requires absorbing the wrong rather than retaliating.",
      "christ_connection": "At the cross, Christ absorbed all our wrongs. 'Father, forgive them' (Luke 23:34). He didn't just declare forgiveness; He paid for it. The debt we could never repay, He cancelled. 'As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions' (Psalm 103:12)."
    },
    "resurrection": {
      "explanation": "Resurrection hope threads through these passages - God's power over death itself. From the binding of Isaac (a 'type' of resurrection, per Hebrews 11:19), to Ezekiel's valley of dry bones, to Daniel's prophecy, the Old Testament anticipates that death will not have the final word.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ's resurrection is the pivot of history. 'If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile' (1 Corinthians 15:17). But He IS risen - the firstfruits of those who sleep. His resurrection guarantees ours. What the Old Testament hoped for, the empty tomb confirms."
    },
    "spirit": {
      "explanation": "The Spirit of God connects these passages - the breath of God that gives life, empowers leaders, inspires prophets, and will one day be poured out on all flesh (Joel 2:28). From hovering over the waters at creation to coming upon judges and kings, the Spirit is God's active presence.",
      "christ_connection": "Jesus was conceived by the Spirit, empowered by the Spirit, and offered Himself through the Spirit. He promised 'another Helper' (John 14:16) - the Spirit who would indwell believers. At Pentecost, what Joel prophesied came to pass. Christ baptizes us with the Holy Spirit."
    },
    "prophecy": {
      "explanation": "Prophetic vision connects these passages - God revealing His plans before they unfold. The prophets were not primarily fortune-tellers but covenant-prosecutors, calling Israel back to faithfulness while pointing forward to God's ultimate intervention.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is the subject of all prophecy. 'The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy' (Revelation 19:10). He fulfilled over 300 Old Testament prophecies. What the prophets saw dimly, He embodied fully. He is the Word the prophets spoke."
    },
    "wisdom": {
      "explanation": "Wisdom's voice echoes through these passages - not mere cleverness but skill in living according to God's design. Biblical wisdom begins with 'the fear of the Lord' (Proverbs 9:10) and leads to flourishing life. Wisdom was present at creation, delighting in humanity.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is 'the wisdom of God' (1 Corinthians 1:24). In Him 'are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge' (Colossians 2:3). The personified Wisdom of Proverbs 8 finds its fulfillment in the incarnate Word. To know Christ is to know true wisdom."
    },
    "worship": {
      "explanation": "Worship connects these passages - the human response to divine revelation. From Abel's accepted offering to the Tabernacle/Temple liturgy to the psalms of David, Scripture shows humanity's need and privilege to worship the Creator. True worship is 'in spirit and truth' (John 4:24).",
      "christ_connection": "Christ is both the perfect worshipper (praying, praising, obeying the Father) and the object of worship (receiving worship from angels and humans). He is the true Temple where God and humanity meet. Through Him, we offer acceptable worship to the Father."
    },
    "suffering": {
      "explanation": "The mystery of suffering links these passages - why the righteous suffer, how God works through pain, what redemptive purposes emerge from trials. Job, the Psalms of lament, the Suffering Servant of Isaiah all wrestle with suffering's meaning.",
      "christ_connection": "Christ entered fully into human suffering - 'a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief' (Isaiah 53:3). The cross transforms suffering's meaning: God uses it for redemption. 'We share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory' (Romans 8:17)."
    }
  },
  "connection_patterns": {
    "promise_fulfillment": {
      "pattern": "Promise in OT → Fulfillment in NT",
      "explanation": "The Old Testament passage contains a promise or prophecy that the New Testament passage shows fulfilled. God's Word never returns void - what He declares, He accomplishes, often in ways more glorious than originally imagined.",
      "example": "Isaiah 7:14 (virgin birth prophecy) → Matthew 1:23 (fulfillment in Mary)"
    },
    "type_antitype": {
      "pattern": "OT Shadow → NT Reality",
      "explanation": "The Old Testament provides a 'type' - a person, event, or institution that prefigures a greater reality in Christ. Types are divinely intended previews, not mere coincidences. The type is real history, but it points beyond itself.",
      "example": "Passover Lamb (Exodus 12) → Christ our Passover (1 Corinthians 5:7)"
    },
    "escalation": {
      "pattern": "Good → Better → Best",
      "explanation": "Scripture often shows escalating revelation - what was partially revealed becomes clearer, what was good becomes better in Christ. The New does not abolish the Old but fulfills and transcends it.",
      "example": "Manna (Exodus 16) → 'I am the bread of life' (John 6:35)"
    },
    "contrast": {
      "pattern": "Human Failure → Divine Success",
      "explanation": "Where humans fail, Christ succeeds. Adam fails in the garden; Christ succeeds in Gethsemane. Israel fails in the wilderness; Christ overcomes temptation. This contrast highlights both human need and divine grace.",
      "example": "Adam's disobedience (Genesis 3) → Christ's obedience (Romans 5:19)"
    },
    "echo": {
      "pattern": "Later Scripture Echoes Earlier",
      "explanation": "The later passage deliberately echoes the earlier, using similar language, imagery, or structure to show continuity. Biblical authors wrote with Scripture in mind, creating a web of inter-textual connections.",
      "example": "'In the beginning' (Genesis 1:1) → 'In the beginning was the Word' (John 1:1)"
    },
    "reversal": {
      "pattern": "Curse → Blessing",
      "explanation": "What was lost or cursed is restored or blessed. The Bible's narrative arc moves from paradise lost to paradise restored, from curse to blessing, from exile to homecoming. Christ reverses the effects of the Fall.",
      "example": "Tree of death (Genesis 3) → Tree of life (Revelation 22:2)"
    }
  },
  "christ_connections": {
    "creation": "Christ was present at creation as the eternal Word (John 1:1-3). 'All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made.' Creation reveals Christ's power and deity. The world was made through Him and for Him (Colossians 1:16).",
    "fall": "The Fall necessitated Christ's coming. The seed of the woman (Genesis 3:15) who would crush the serpent's head is the first messianic prophecy. Where Adam failed and brought death, Christ would succeed and bring life. The whole Bible after Genesis 3 answers the question: How will God fix this?",
    "flood": "The ark prefigures salvation in Christ. As Noah and his family were saved through water, so we are saved through baptism into Christ (1 Peter 3:20-21). Christ is our ark of salvation - the only refuge from judgment. The dove and olive branch point to the Spirit and peace.",
    "abraham": "God's promise to Abraham - 'in you all families of the earth shall be blessed' (Genesis 12:3) - finds fulfillment in Christ. Paul explicitly says 'the Scripture... preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham' (Galatians 3:8). Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day (John 8:56). Christ is Abraham's seed.",
    "isaac": "Isaac is perhaps the clearest Old Testament type of Christ. The beloved son, carried wood up a mountain for sacrifice, was spared at the last moment when God provided a substitute. Abraham's willingness to offer his only son mirrors the Father's gift of His only Son.",
    "jacob": "Jacob's ladder (Genesis 28) with angels ascending and descending prefigures Christ. Jesus told Nathanael, 'You will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man' (John 1:51). Christ is the true ladder connecting heaven and earth.",
    "joseph": "Joseph's life parallels Christ: beloved of the father, hated by brothers, sold for silver, falsely accused, seemingly dead, then exalted to save those who wronged him. 'You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good' (Genesis 50:20) - the story of the cross.",
    "moses": "Moses is explicitly a type of Christ. God promised 'a prophet like me' (Deuteronomy 18:15). Moses delivered Israel from Egypt; Christ delivers from sin. Moses gave manna; Christ is the true bread. Moses mediated the old covenant; Christ mediates the new. Yet Moses was servant; Christ is Son (Hebrews 3:5-6).",
    "passover": "The Passover lamb directly prefigures Christ. Unblemished, slain at twilight, its blood applied for salvation, no bone broken (John 19:36). 'Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed' (1 Corinthians 5:7). The Exodus is the Old Testament gospel - deliverance by blood and power.",
    "tabernacle": "Every element of the Tabernacle points to Christ. He is the sacrifice on the altar, the laver of cleansing, the bread of the presence, the light of the lampstand, the fragrant offering of incense, the mercy seat where God meets man. 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us' (John 1:14).",
    "priesthood": "The Levitical priesthood was provisional, pointing to Christ the perfect High Priest. Priests served as mediators; Christ is the one mediator. Priests offered daily; Christ once for all. Priests died; Christ lives forever. He is priest after Melchizedek's order - royal and eternal (Hebrews 7).",
    "david": "David is the great type of Christ the King. God promised David an eternal throne (2 Samuel 7), fulfilled only in Christ. Jesus is 'Son of David' - the rightful heir. David was shepherd-king; Christ is the Good Shepherd and King of kings. David wrote psalms about Christ (Psalm 22, 110).",
    "temple": "The Temple was God's dwelling among His people, pointing to Christ. Jesus said, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up' - speaking of His body (John 2:19-21). Now we are temples of the Holy Spirit, and the Church is a holy temple in the Lord (Ephesians 2:21).",
    "prophets": "All the prophets testify to Christ (Acts 10:43). Isaiah saw His virgin birth, suffering, and glory. Jeremiah prophesied the new covenant. Ezekiel envisioned the living temple. Daniel saw the Son of Man. Micah named Bethlehem. Zechariah foretold the entry and piercing. They spoke of the grace to come in Christ (1 Peter 1:10-12).",
    "exile": "The exile and return pattern prefigures Christ's work. Israel was exiled for sin; we are exiles from Eden. The return from Babylon was only partial; the true return comes through Christ who leads captivity captive. He brings the ultimate homecoming - reconciliation with God.",
    "wisdom": "The personified Wisdom of Proverbs 8 - present at creation, delighting in humanity - finds fulfillment in Christ, 'the wisdom of God' (1 Corinthians 1:24). In Christ 'are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge' (Colossians 2:3). To find wisdom is to find Christ.",
    "psalms": "The Psalms are the prayer book of Christ and His Church. Jesus prayed Psalm 22 from the cross, Psalm 31 at His death, Psalm 118 at His entry. The Psalms express His sufferings, His trust, His victory. When we pray the Psalms, we pray with and to Christ."
